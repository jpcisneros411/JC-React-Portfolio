  ## Description 

  This Portfolio contains information that includes my background professional, a selection of projects I've been a part of or have completed, a link to my resume, and contact information for anyone who would like to discuss my work or opportunities. This Portfolio utilizes React in order to render a website on a single page instead of having a user bounce back and forth so they will be able to have a more engaging experience.
